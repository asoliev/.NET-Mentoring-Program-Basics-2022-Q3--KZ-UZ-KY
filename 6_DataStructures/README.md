Questions for the self-check:
1.	What is a Data Structure?
2.	What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
3.	How is an Array different from Linked List?
4.	What is Stack and where can it be used?
5.	What is a Queue, how it is different from the stack and how is it implemented?
6.	What is a Linked List and What are its types?
7.	Which data structures C# have?
8.	List C# collections features.
9.	What is the algorithmic complexity of collections?

You are given a solution (DataStructures.zip) containing the task project and the tests. Your task is to implement methods (details below) until the tests are green.

### Part 1:
Implement linked list (DoublyLinkedList.cs) with functions:
- Length
- Add
- AddAt
- Remove
- RemoveAt
- ElementAt

Implement IEnumerable to make your list work with for each (NOTE: you SHOULD NOT use YIELD operator)

### Part 2:
Implement the interface IHybridFlowProcessor<T> (HybridFlowProcessor.cs) using single internal item "storage" for both FILO and FIFO flows. Use a Double linked list in your implementation. Reusing your code from the previous task is desirable.
