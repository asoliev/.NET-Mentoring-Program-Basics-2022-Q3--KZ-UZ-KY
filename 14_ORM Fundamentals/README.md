 https://learn.epam.com/myLearning/program?groupGuid=d8951fce-b848-42aa-99c1-606b443aed19

Questions for the self-check:
1.	What is ORM?
2.	What is the difference between micro and fully featured ORM?
3.	When will you choose Dapper and when EF Core?
4.	What is the deference between Code, Database and Model first approaches?
5.	What is the purpose of ‘Unit of Work’ pattern?



Statuses: Not Started, Loading, InProgress, Arrived, Unloading, Cancelled, Done.

### Functional requirements:
Create a library and a linked test library which cover the following requirements:
1. Ability to perform CRUD operations on product.
2. Ability to perform CRUD operations on order.
3. Ability to fetch all products.
4. Ability to fetch orders (consider filtration by month, status, year, or specific product, use stored procedure).
5. Ability to delete orders in bulk (on the same conditions as in item 4).

### NB! Scoreboard:

1-3 stars – The task has been implemented by using one of the ORMs.
4-5 stars – The task was implemented using both ORMs (separate applications, no need to combine both ORM in a single solution).
